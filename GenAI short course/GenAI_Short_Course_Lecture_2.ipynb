        "Prompt Engineering (PE) is the primary vehicle for guiding generative AI models towards stable applications. It is particularly applicable to Large Language Models (LLMs) and involves formulating prompts and prompting schemas in order to retrieve appropriate responses to queries. It is essential for meaningful interactions with LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook, which is the second of two notebooks, provides a hands-on introduction to PE for end users with a basic understanding of the Python programming language. No advanced coding or technical background knowledge of generative AI or LLM is required for completing the exercises in the notebook. The notebook is divided into three sections, each corresponding to material covered in two live seminars. There will be ~60 minutes available in order to go through and complete exercise 3.\n",

        "  * **Searching the internet for recent information** LLMs are generally pre-trained and thus have a knowledge cutoff at the time when training stopped. The latest GPT-4 model of OpenAI for example has a knowledge cutoff at January 2022. This means that it was not trained on any data produced after that time, so if we want to include updated information this must be done by fetching the information and providing it as context together with our query.\n",
        "  * **Using your own PDF documents as a knowledge base** (plugin: AskYourPDF). There are several plugins available for GPT-4 which provide the capability of uploading a PDF document and use it as a reference for interacting with the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.) The third exercise is more programming heavy and involves working with API calls. We'll guide you through it! This allows us to perform more complex tasks and write our own custom functions utilizing the power of the LLM. We introduce the Python library [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) and some of its tools for manipulating prompts. This allows for more intricate problem-solving as well as gaining control over the reliability of the output. We will see how to use this in order to accomplish Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) from our own knowledge base (the PDF document).
