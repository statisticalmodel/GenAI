The latest GPT-4 model of OpenAI for example has a knowledge cutoff at January 2022. This means that it was not trained on any data produced after that time, so if we want to include updated information this must be done by fetching the information and providing it as context together with our query.\n",

        "  * Prompting helps in formulating the input in a way that the model can understand and respond to effectively. A well-crafted prompt can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the model's output.\n",
        "  * Through prompting, you can guide the model's responses in a particular direction or within certain boundaries. This is crucial for obtaining accurate, relevant, or safe responses.\n",

        "  * Transform text into a format which is directly useful for you. This includes e.g. language translation or formatting the output as excel table, JSON dictionary, MarkDown or html.\n",
        "  * Get feedback and suggestions for improvement and introspection. This may include both natural language text and code.\n",
        "  * Infer sentiment, topic and logic structure in text.\n",
        "  * Generate/revise drafts for planning, policies, mails, slides and more.\n",
        "  * Brainstorming partner and ideation, an extra brain in the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Important techniques**\n",
        "  * **Best practices** - Write clearly and use semantic clues rather than keyword searching. Clearly state your goals and wishes, have an intent with your promt. In some sense it is like moving back to how you perhaps intuitively wanted to interact with e.g. Google when searching internet. Or how you would ask an all-knowing oracle. Don't be afraid to interact, provide feedback and follow up when the output is not what you desired.\n",
        "  * **Role Task Format (RTF)** - Give the LLM a *role*, to set it in the right *mood*, define a clear *task* to be achieved and provide a couple of examples of how you want to *format* the output.\n",
        "  * **In Context Learning (ICL)** - Provide examples and any additional information to consider as context for your prompt. This allows for a *shallow* learning, where the LLM can learn from your prompt without updating any weights of the model. It is easier to make the bigger models accept new information in the prompt and generalize from that. The smaller models are more locked into the worldview built from training.\n",
        "  * **Chain of Thought (CoT)** - Ask the model to think through problems logically and in a step-by-step manner. This helps the model to linearize the problem into a sequence of logical considerations and often produce more accurate output.\n",
        "  * **Tree of Thought (ToT)** - Takes inspiration from the way human minds work when considering complex problems, following different branches of thoughts out to explore diverse reaosning paths. Generate a few different suggestions for how to solve a given problem and rank these suggestions by having an LLM reflect on the solutions given the original problem. Keep the best approach for a solution, then generate a a few new suggestions for proceeding towards a final solution and rerank. Again, keep the best and iterate until satisfied that the best solution has been reached. Can become quite intensive in the amount of API calls made to the LLM.\n",

        "These techniques usually take us very far and form a basis for more advanced applications built on chaining prompts."
